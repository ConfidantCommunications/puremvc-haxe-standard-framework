You can run unit tests for all supported platforms:
- flash 6, 7, 8, 9: open the 'indexFl.html' file located in 'test_deploy'
- javascript: open the 'indexJs.html' file located in 'test_deploy' (there seems to be a bug on Safari and test messages are not traced)
- neko: open terminal and change the direcotry path to the 'test_deploy' folder. Next type 'neko testRunner.n' (you must have nekoVM installed)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile unit tests:
open terminal and change the directory path to the pureMVC folder. Next type 'haxe build_test.hxml' (you must have haxe installed). On widows systems you can simply double-click on the 'build_test.hxml' file.
